# Reinforcement-Learning-Snake-Game

I following the tutorial here to complete this project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8ypSXwyBds

I mainly followed along with the video and wrote notes, adding comments to help myself understand the code's functionality. This project could serve as a foundation for future neural network projects. Building on this, other game ideas come to mind that could benefit from neural network solvers, such as Minesweeper. Creating an agent to solve Minesweeper could provide an entertaining loop of continuous and rapid playthroughs of the game. Overall, I hope to expand upon this project and use it as a reference for future endeavors.

The project contains...

SnakeGame.py - Snake game that can be played by a person.

SnakeGameAI.py - Snake game that has been updated to only allow the agent or computer to play.

agent.py - Game "player" which merges everything together to play the game.

model.py - Linear QNet model with optimizer. Not sure how this stuff actually works. Will need to dive deeper into the actual process it goes through to learn.

helper.py - Creates the plot of the number of games vs performance (score)

.ttf Files - These are font files for the game
