# Reinforcement-Learning-Snake-Game

I made this coding following the tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8ypSXwyBds

Mainly followed along and wrote along with the video but added comments to help myself understand the code's functionality.

The project contains...

SnakeGame.py - Snake game that can be played by a person.

SnakeGameAI.py - Snake game that has been updated to only allow the agent or computer to play.

agent.py - Game "player" which merges everything together to play the game.

model.py - Linear QNet model with optimizer. Not sure how this stuff actually works. Will need to dive deeper into the actual process it goes through to learn.

helper.py - Creates the plot of the number of games vs performance (score)

.ttf Files - These are font files for the game
